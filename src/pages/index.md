  title: Software Developer, Advisory
  responsibilities:
  - Developed new product features, diagnosed and fixed bugs reported in all areas of the USA Food Safety/ USA Safe Inspect web application. The application was originally developed for the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture using VB.NET using .NET Framework 4.5.2, MS SQL Server 2008 R2 and Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS).
  - Extended and implemented the USA Food Safety solution in 11 additional organizations. Conducted onsite user training sessions for field users and admin staff.

  - Mentored and led a team of 8 software developers in development efforts and process improvement.
  - Automated builds for each check in across three supported application versions, verifying the application would build and all stored procedures would execute successfully using Azure Devops and Powershell scripts.
  - Implemented nightly releases for the last successful build through Azure Devops, eliminating the need for a lead engineer to manually update more than 20 working environments and allowing QA to rely on application version and build number to determine what work was completed.
  - Streamlined and simplified release process for deployment team Azure Devops and a custom tool for managing DML SQL Scripts. This eliminated human error in production deployments and saved time and frustration for product ownership in understanding what issues were released between versions.
  - Developed a Web API using ASP.NET MVC Architecture to allow users to submit photos associated with the inspection via an Android app. Utilized Owin Token based authentication, Unity MVC Dependency injection, Entity Framework 6 and AutoMapper object-object mapping. The API was used as a bolt on to the existing web app as a starting point for modernizing the Web Forms application.
  - Managed application deployments for all on-prem and cloud hosted (Xtium) implementations staging environments and production environments.
